    <p> &emsp; I am so ecstatic that I am approaching two years with the love of my life and my one true person - YOU!
        The memories we have forged together this past year are unforgettable; I still remember our late night online
        escape rooms, experiencing the blessed food in Las Vegas (and playings lots of Blackjack :D), showing you around my hometown,
        FINALLY finishing Game of Thrones, studying together with Boba on your lap and Pip on my laptop, and last but not least,
        a couple weeks ago when I was able to visit you and finally share a New Year's kiss. 2024 put me down a lot of the time, but
        I truly experienced so many of the happiest moments of my life, and when I think back on them, 
        every single one was shared with you.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        &emsp; I genuinely love every second that we spend together, every moment we share, and every memory we own. So, I have to ask you,
        Charleen Pua, love of my life, will you do me the honor of being my Valentine?
